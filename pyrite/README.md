# Pyrite Theme

Pyrite is a Discord Theme inspired by ClearVision and is built off the core of a stale branch.

Due to the differences between Canary, PTB and Stable as well as Discord Experiments you might not have an area themed. Speak up for it on the [Support Server](https://discord.gg/W976FZS) and someone will fix it up for you.

*Replugged plugin support has since been dropped but you can still use the theme once converted into a .asar file. You can do so on this page: https://replugged-org.github.io/theme-converter/*

### Previews:

*The below screenshots may not be up to date as Discord changes things constantly. Both the Border Radius/Radical Status and the User Modal Layout addons were enabled.*
